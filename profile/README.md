# >commit
\>commit is the first transatlantic VC fund focused on Commercial Open Source Startups. We back technical founders early and help them turning open source projects into category-defining businesses.

\>commit is a part of the [Red River West](https://www.redriverwest.com/) family.

## What makes us different
**Data** - We've built proprietary tooling to track open source adoption signals before they show up in revenue metrics - from usage activity to community growth to shipping velocity.

**Open source network** - We gathered 100+ open source founders and executives in the >commit community. Our advisors have built companies like Hugging Face, Mozilla, Supabase, Nginx, among others. Our portfolio companies get direct access to founders who've solved the problems they're facing.

**Transatlantic bridge** - European technical depth, American go-to-market intensity. We help founders build in Europe and scale globally from day one.


## What we invest in
**Stage** - Pre-seed & Seed

**Model** - Commercial Open Source & Community-driven software

**Check size** - Up to $2M initial investment

We care about project velocity, community engagement, and founders who understand both the technical and commercial sides of open source.


## Portfolio
We're actively investing from Fund I.
